> You guys know who [Philo Farnsworth][] was?

> He invented [television][]. I don't mean, he invented television like [Uncle
Miltie][] - I mean, he *invented* the *television*. In a little house in [Provo,
Utah][]. At a time when the idea of transmitting moving pictures through the
air, would be like me saying I figured out a way to beam us aboard the
[Starship *Enterprise*][].

> He was a visionary. He died broke, and without fanfare. The guy I really
like, though? Was his brother-in-law, Cliff Gardner. He said, "Philo, I know
everyone thinks you're crazy, but I want to be a part of this. Now, I don't
have your head for science, so I'm not going to be able to help much with
the design and the mechanics of the invention, but it sounds like, you're
gonna need **glass tubes**."

> You see, Philo was inventing the cathode receptor. And even though, Cliff
didn't know what that meant, or how it worked, he'd seen Philo's drawing,
and he knew he was gonna need glass tubes. And since television hadn't been
invented yet, it's not like you could get 'em at the local TV repair shop.
"I want to be a part of this," Cliff said. "I don't have your head for
science. How would it be, if I were to teach myself to be a glass-blower,
and I could set up a little shop, in the back yard? And I could make all the
tubes you'll need for testing."

> There ought to be [Congressional medals][] for people like that.

> I've looked over the notes you've been giving over the last year or so, and I
have to say, they exhibit an almost total lack of understanding of how to get
the best from talented people.

> You said before, that, for whatever reason, I seem to be able to exert some
authority around here? I assure you: it's not 'cause they like me. It's cause
they knew, two minutes after I walked in the door: I'm someone who knows how
to do something. I can help. **I can make glass tubes.**

> That's what they need.

> - Sam Donovan (William H. Macy), [*Sports Night* Episode 26, "Cliff Gardner"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-va0tWJLTc)
